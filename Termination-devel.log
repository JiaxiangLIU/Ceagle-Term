Need to support:
- additional arguments of instruction _alloca_: e.g., allocate memory space of t * size(i32)
- instruction _getelementptr_
- instruction _trunc_

Known unsupported things in TPDB benchmark:
- instruction _srem_: I think it cannot be supported because of the backend KITTeL
- instruction _sdiv_: I think it cannot be supported because of the backend KITTeL, unless referring to the method used by llvm2kittel
- instruction _unreachable_
